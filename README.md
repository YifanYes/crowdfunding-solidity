# Crowdfunding Smart Contract

The Admin will start a campaign for crowdfunding with a specific monetary goal and deadline.

Contributors will contribute to pay to that project by sending ETH.

The Admin has to create a Spending Request to spend money for the campaign.

Once the spending request has been created, the contributors can start voting for that specific spending request.

If more than 50% of the total contributors voted for that request, then the admin would have the permission to spend the amount specified in the spending request.

**The power is moved from the campaign's admin to those that donated money.**

The contributors can request a refund if the monetary goal was not reached within the deadline.
